# Deepfake Video and Audio Detection

This project is designed to detect deepfake videos and audio using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It leverages transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to analyze visual and auditory data, providing a reliable solution for identifying AI-generated content. The goal is to ensure content authenticity and mitigate the spread of misinformation.

## Features
- **Video Analysis**: Detects tampered or AI-generated video frames using transformer-based models.
- **Audio Analysis**: Identifies synthesized or altered audio patterns for enhanced accuracy.
- **Combined Detection**: Integrates video and audio analysis for comprehensive deepfake detection.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily adapt the architecture for specific datasets or applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Frameworks for building and training deep learning models.
- **RNNs (LSTM)**: For capturing audio temporal dependencies.
- **FFmpeg**: For video and audio preprocessing.
- **MoviePy**: For video and audio preprocessing.
- **OpenCV**: For processing of video frames.
- **Resnet**: For transfer learning.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset:
2. Train the model:
3. Test the model:
4. Analyze results:
   The output will include a report indicating whether the content is a deepfake.
